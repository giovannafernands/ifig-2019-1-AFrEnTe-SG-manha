Advanced Front End Technologies Study Group

This is a test repository, where all study group members can contribute and push their own tests using front-end technologies, such as JavaScript, CSS, SCSS, WebGL and so on.

Started in April 9th, 2019, our aim is to study and discuss the uses of recent technologies in front-end.

This will serve as a complementary study for students of *Inform√°tica para Internet* technical course, on *Instituto Federal de Pernambuco, campus Igarassu*.
